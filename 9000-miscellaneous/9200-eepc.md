## 9200 - Endpoint Encryption PC ##

Endpoint Encryption PC (EEPC) is a new encryption software that is being implemented by the Partners Helpdesk on our desktop computers. The software works by requiring an additional username and password for the computer to boot into Windows, similar to how TrueCrypt and SafeBoot function. Currently, Michael Cailler (mcailler@research.bwh.harvard.edu), Michael Rueschman (mrueschman@research.bwh.harvard.edu), Kevin Gleason (kgleason1@partners.org), and Dan Mobley (dmobley@partners.org) are all 'superusers' and can unlock any machine. If you have not been added to a machine and need it unlocked, please contact one of these individuals. Users who wish to be added to a machine with unlocking privileges can contact John Weng (jweng@rics.bwh.harvard.edu) or Davis Mirilla (dmirilla@partners.org)
