## 9030 Request a Partners Email Account

In order to setup another **@partners.org** email account, you must send a request to the Partners Email Access group. Simply send an email to emailaccess@partners.org that contains the following information:

1. Your name
2. Your Partners username
3. Institution (MGH, BWH, etc.)
4. Office location
5. Phone number
6. Requested email account name (e.g. **myfavoritestudy@partners.org**)
7. A brief purpose of the requested account
8. Co-owners of the new email account (if applicable)

The final point is important because the Email Access group will setup this email account as a group mailbox, which then becomes associated with the primary Partners email accounts of the owner and co-owners.
