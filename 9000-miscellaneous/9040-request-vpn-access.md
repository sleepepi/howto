## 9040 Request VPN Access

Staff who require remote access should request access to the Partners Virtual Private Network (VPN). In essence, when connected to VPN the user's internet connection behaves as if it were within the institutional firewall. This makes tasks like connecting to shared network drives and remote computers possible.

The request process takes a couple weeks, after which a VPN "token" is mailed to your home address with instructions on how to use it. Follow these steps to request access:

1. Obtain prior approval from your manager for remote access
2. Notify Bonnie Wheeler (bwheeler1@partners.org) of this approval
3. Fill out request form at: http://is.partners.org/isam/vpnrequests/add1.asp (login with Partners credentials)

Once you have the VPN token, **try not to lose it** because there is a replacement fee of $75. Also, the token expires after 2-3 years (expiration date is on the back), at which point they must be exchanged. You will be notified when the expiration date is upcoming, and be sure that you mail back the **old** token and not the **new** one. If you happen to make the mistake of mailing back the new token, **it will be treated as lost and you will be charged $75 for another**.
