## 9050 Lookup Partners User Information

At times, it is useful to lookup details about a particular Partner user, and the institution provides [a simple application for looking up Partners user information](http://helpdeskqueries.partners.org/userinfo/test13.html). A name or username is required to use the lookup, and when prompted for a username and password use your own Partners credentials to complete the query.

The application is useful for finding usernames (if only the name is known), e-mail addresses, job titles, and drive mappings.
