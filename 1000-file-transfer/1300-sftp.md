## 1300 SFTP

Our group uses an SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) server offered by Partners Enterprise Applications in order to facilitate file transfers from our external data collection sites. The SFTP accounts closely link with [Diplomat](https://github.com/sleepepi/howto/blob/master/1000-file-transfer/1100-diplomat/1100-diplomat.md) jobs.

When setting up a new project with new sites and new SFTP accounts, open a [Help Desk Ticket](http://helpdeskselfservice.partners.org) (routed to Partners Enterprise Applications) that describes the project and sites that require accounts.
