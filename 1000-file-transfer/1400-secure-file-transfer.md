## 1400 Secure File Transfer

Access Partners Research Computing's Secure File Transfer site at this URL: [https://transfer.partners.org](https://transfer.partners.org)

As a means of transferring files to collaborators both inside and outside the firewall, our group has often used this service. The service is useful for sending large files (>1 GB) and for creating shared workspaces amongst a group of collaborators.

> Partners Research Computing offers a [Secure File Transfer & Collabortion](http://rc.partners.org/sFTP) solution for exchanging large files with collaborators both inside and outside of Partners via a web browser.  There is a new feature called Workspaces which allow teams (internal and external) to streamline workflow and keep projects moving forward. Users can review, comment, upload, and download files and use mobile apps to access the Workspaces.  This service is a secure web based application with anti-virus detection built in.   All files added to the system are encrypted during transfer and are scanned for viruses.  Recipients receive an email with a link to download the files.

When sending files to new users outside of Partners, they will be able to sign-up on the site after clicking the file download link.
