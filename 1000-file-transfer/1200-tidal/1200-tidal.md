## 1200 Tidal

Tidal is an application used at Partners for the exchange of files from one internal system to another within the institution's firewall. We have used this model to support routine file transfers for Embletta downloads on the BestAIR trial and for a collaboration with researchers at MGH who needed to regularly transfer files to us.
