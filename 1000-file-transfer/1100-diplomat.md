## 1100 Diplomat

[Diplomat Transfer](http://rc.partners.org/diplomat) is an application used at Partners for the exchange of files (both incoming and outgoing to the institution.) For most Sleep Reading Center projects, Diplomat is used as a means to routinely and securely transfer data that collaborating sites upload to our SFTP server. Typically, a single Diplomat "job" is created for each site on a given project.
