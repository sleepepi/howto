## 2500 Sleep Clinic Share

The [BWH Sleep Clinic](http://www.brighamandwomens.org/Departments_and_Services/medicine/services/sleepmedicine/for_patients.aspx?sub=1) uses a network share on PHSNETAPP2 (the same Network Attached Storage that houses [Home Drives](https://github.com/sleepepi/howto/blob/master/2000-file-storage/2400-home-drive-h.md)). This **Sleep Clinic Share** is used to house clinical data, including sleep study downloads from the Noxturnal software. The primary users of the share are physicians and clinic staff and access is granted by keygivers through the Partners Authorization System.

The path to the share is: **\\\phsnetapp2\bwhsleepclinic$**
