## 2200 Massive Array of Disks (MAD)

The [Massive Array of Disks (MAD for short)](http://rc.partners.org/storage/mad) is a data archival solution capable of housing many TBs of data, which our group has used since the transition from Cleveland to Boston in mid-2010. The system is managed by Partners Research Computing, who describe the system as follows:

> The Massive Array of Disks project provides the research community with a cost-effective, massively scalable, archival performance tier of storage that is centrally located within the highly secure PHS datacenter. This tier of storage should be considered for data that needs to be kept online and accessible but does not require frequent access or connection to applications that will operate on this data.  MAD targets data that is written once and read seldom, where the files typically undergo little to no changes over time. The data's utility is high enough, however, that it needs to remains on-line and accessible for an extended period of time.

Our group has a single account called **redlinesleep** that houses backup copies of data from many projects, particularly older Sleep Reading Center studies. As of August 2013, our total storage used was more than 15 TB. Current usage [statistics are available here](http://mad.partners.org/usage/).
