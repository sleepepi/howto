## 2100 Research File Area (RFA)

[Research File Area (RFA for short)](http://rc.partners.org/storage/rfa) has been the primary data storage system for our group since mid-2011. The system is managed by Partners Research Computing, who describe the system as follows:

> RFA is a low-cost, pay as you go storage tier similar to a Shared or Dedicated File Area (SFA, DFA).  It is designed to meet the very large file storage requirements common to research.  This solution provides a level of access and flexibility not available in existing solutions.

> Research File Areas are ideal for researchers whose projects generate large data sets or large numbers of files that then need to be analyzed or managed. In addition to size, RFA's give researchers the ability to finely control access to data. Unlike SFAs and DFAs access permissions can be controlled at all levels of the file share to allow portions of data to be available to only a subset of users.
