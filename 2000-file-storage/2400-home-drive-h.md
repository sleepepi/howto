## 2400 Home Drive (H:)

Every Partners HealthCare employee receives 100 GB of space to use in the form of their **Home Drive**, commonly referred to as the **H: Drive** because it is often mapped automatically on Windows machines to H:. The space is located on the PHSNETAPP network attached storage (NAS) that the hospital IT department manages. The Home Drive is useful for keeping files stored on the network, making them available from wherever the user is logged in. Further, files on the H: Drive are regularly backed up and can be restored if something is lost.
