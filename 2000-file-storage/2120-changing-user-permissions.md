## 2120 - Changing User Permissions ##

In order to change user permissions on an RFA share, follow the instructions below. Permissions are granted [based on Partners account usernames](https://github.com/sleepepi/howto/blob/master/9000-miscellaneous/9050-lookup-partners-user-information.md).

### Windows 7

1. Open a new explorer window to the RFA location of interest
2. Right click on the folder or file for which permissions must be set
3. Click **Properties**, then click **Security**, and finally click **Edit**
4. From the list of **Group or user names**, either click **Add** or **Remove** on the user(s) of interest
5. Most users should be granted **Allow** access for all options except **Full control** and **Special permissions**
6. Click **Apply** when finished

If the folder contains a large number of files, it may take a few minutes to fully change the user permissions. More specialized permissions options are also located under the **Security** tab.
