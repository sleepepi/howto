## 5300 - Spacelabs Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor Report Managment System ##

* Note: To install the Spacelabs ABPM software, you will either have to to be using a machine running Windows XP or install Microsoft's [Virtual PC](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002) to emulate Windows XP

After logging into your XP machine, the software install disc can be found in BLI-231. Follow the install instructions on the disc and create a username and password for the software. Because the blood pressure databases are kept locally, you will only be able to access patients that are downloaded to your computer. For monitors that are programmed on different machines, the patient information will have to be re-entered as part of the monitor download process.
