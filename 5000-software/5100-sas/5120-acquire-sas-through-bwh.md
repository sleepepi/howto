## 5120 â€“ Acquire SAS through BWH ##

**Note:** In order to acquire SAS through Brigham & Women's, you must have a valid BWH ID.
**Note:** BWH has currently reached its license cap for SAS, meaning new users are currently unable to receive SAS from the hospital. Users that request SAS will be added to a waiting list and will receive licenses as they are returned into the pool.

  - To acquire a SAS 9.2 license from BWH, submit a help desk [ticket](http://helpdesk.partners.org/computerhd/issues/xnewissue.asp) with the following information:
    * Your office location (221 Longwood Ave)
    * Your division (Sleep Medicine)
    * Your Windows version (XP/7, 32-bit/64-bit)
    * Your RICS tag, which can be found on the top of all computer towers
  - After your request is approved, you should receive an e-mail from the help desk with a link to install SAS
  - Your license is good for 1 year - you should receive an email from the help desk each year with information on how to renew the license
